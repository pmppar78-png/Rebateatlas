      <h1>HEAR High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate — Complete Guide</h1>

      <p>The High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate Act, commonly known as HEAR (and formerly referred to as HEEHRA during the legislative process), is a groundbreaking federal program that provides <strong>point-of-sale rebates</strong> for qualifying electric home upgrades. Unlike tax credits that require you to wait until you file your taxes and have sufficient tax liability, HEAR rebates are applied at the time of purchase — meaning the discount appears directly on your receipt or invoice. With a maximum benefit of <strong>$14,000 per household</strong>, HEAR is specifically designed to make electrification affordable for low- and moderate-income Americans.</p>

      <h2>Income Qualification: Who Is Eligible</h2>
      <p>HEAR is an income-qualified program, which means not all homeowners are eligible. The program uses Area Median Income (AMI) as the benchmark, with two tiers of eligibility:</p>

      <h3>Households Below 80% AMI</h3>
      <p>If your household income falls below 80% of your area's median income, you qualify for rebates covering up to <strong>100% of the cost</strong> of eligible upgrades, subject to the per-item and per-household caps. This tier is intended for low-income households and provides the most generous benefit level.</p>

      <h3>Households Between 80% and 150% AMI</h3>
      <p>If your household income falls between 80% and 150% of your area's median income, you qualify for rebates covering up to <strong>50% of the cost</strong> of eligible upgrades, again subject to the per-item caps. This moderate-income tier still provides substantial savings, particularly for high-cost items like heat pumps.</p>

      <h3>Households Above 150% AMI</h3>
      <p>Households with income above 150% AMI are <strong>not eligible</strong> for HEAR rebates. However, these households can still access the Section 25C tax credit, the HOMES rebate program, and various state and utility incentives. The 150% AMI threshold varies dramatically by location — in San Francisco, 150% AMI for a family of four could exceed $200,000, while in rural Mississippi it might be $65,000. Your local program administrator can help you determine whether your household income qualifies.</p>

      <h2>Specific Rebate Amounts by Item</h2>
      <p>HEAR provides defined maximum rebate amounts for each category of eligible equipment. These are per-household lifetime maximums, not annual limits:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Heat pump for space heating and cooling</strong> — up to <strong>$8,000</strong>. This is the single largest rebate available under HEAR and covers air-source, ground-source, and ductless mini-split heat pump systems. Leading manufacturers include <a href="https://www.mitsubishicomfort.com/" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Mitsubishi Electric</a>, <a href="https://www.carrier.com/" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Carrier</a>, and <a href="https://www.daikincomfort.com/" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Daikin</a>.</li>
        <li><strong>Heat pump water heater</strong> — up to <strong>$1,750</strong>. Heat pump water heaters use roughly one-third the energy of conventional electric resistance water heaters, making them one of the most cost-effective electrification upgrades available. Popular models from <a href="https://www.rheem.com/" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Rheem</a> and <a href="https://www.aosmith.com/" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">A.O. Smith</a> are widely available.</li>
        <li><strong>Electric stove, cooktop, range, or oven</strong> — up to <strong>$840</strong>. This includes induction cooktops and standard electric ranges. Induction technology offers faster heating, precise temperature control, and improved indoor air quality compared to gas cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Electric heat pump clothes dryer</strong> — up to <strong>$840</strong>. Heat pump dryers use significantly less energy than conventional electric dryers and operate at lower temperatures, which is gentler on fabrics.</li>
        <li><strong>Electrical panel upgrade</strong> — up to <strong>$4,000</strong>. Many older homes have 100-amp or 150-amp electrical panels that cannot support the additional load from heat pumps, EV chargers, and other electric appliances. Upgrading to a 200-amp panel is often a prerequisite for full home electrification.</li>
        <li><strong>Electric wiring</strong> — up to <strong>$2,500</strong>. This covers the cost of new wiring or circuit installation needed to support the qualifying electric equipment being installed.</li>
        <li><strong>Insulation, air sealing, and ventilation</strong> — up to <strong>$1,600</strong>. These building envelope improvements ensure that new electric heating and cooling equipment operates at peak efficiency.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>The $14,000 Household Maximum</h2>
      <p>While the individual item caps add up to more than $14,000 when combined, the total HEAR benefit per household is capped at <strong>$14,000</strong>. This means you can mix and match qualifying upgrades, but your total rebates cannot exceed $14,000 regardless of how many items you purchase. Strategic planning is important — if you are considering multiple upgrades, prioritize the items that provide the greatest energy savings and financial benefit for your specific home.</p>

      <p>For a household below 80% AMI, a realistic package might include an $8,000 heat pump rebate, a $1,750 heat pump water heater rebate, a $2,500 wiring rebate, and a $1,600 insulation rebate — totaling $13,850, just under the cap. For a household between 80% and 150% AMI, the 50% cost limitation means the effective rebates will typically be lower than the stated maximums.</p>

      <h2>How Point-of-Sale Rebates Work</h2>
      <p>The point-of-sale mechanism is what makes HEAR unique among federal energy programs. Instead of paying full price and waiting months to receive a tax credit when you file, the HEAR rebate is applied at the time of purchase. Here is how the process typically works:</p>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Income verification</strong>: You provide proof of income to the program administrator or participating retailer/contractor. Many states are developing streamlined verification systems, including categorical eligibility (automatic qualification if you participate in certain assistance programs like SNAP or Medicaid).</li>
        <li><strong>Equipment selection</strong>: You choose qualifying equipment from a participating retailer or contractor.</li>
        <li><strong>Rebate application at checkout</strong>: The rebate amount is deducted from your purchase price or contractor invoice. You pay only the net amount.</li>
        <li><strong>Retailer/contractor reimbursement</strong>: The retailer or contractor submits the rebate claim to the state program administrator for reimbursement from federal funds.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>This approach eliminates the need for upfront capital and removes the barrier that tax credits pose for households with low tax liability. It is particularly impactful for renters and low-income homeowners who may not have the financial resources to pay full price and wait for reimbursement.</p>

      <h2>State-by-State Launch Status</h2>
      <p>Like the HOMES program, HEAR is administered by individual states, and the rollout timeline varies across the country. The DOE allocated approximately <strong>$4.5 billion</strong> in total HEAR funding. Each state must establish its own program infrastructure, including income verification systems, retailer/contractor networks, and rebate processing platforms. As of early 2026, several states have launched their HEAR programs or are conducting pilot programs, while others are still in the development phase. The pace of state launches has been accelerating, with more programs expected to come online throughout 2026 and 2027. Check your state page on Rebate Atlas for the latest status in your area.</p>

      <h2>Stacking Rules: HEAR and Other Programs</h2>
      <p>Understanding how HEAR interacts with other incentive programs is critical to maximizing your total benefit:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>HEAR and HOMES</strong>: You <strong>cannot</strong> use both HEAR and HOMES rebates for the same individual upgrade. If you receive an $8,000 HEAR rebate for a heat pump, that heat pump cannot also be counted toward your HOMES whole-home energy savings rebate. However, you can use HEAR for some upgrades and HOMES for others within the same home.</li>
        <li><strong>HEAR and Section 25C</strong>: You <strong>cannot</strong> claim the 25C tax credit on costs that were already covered by a HEAR rebate. If HEAR covered the full cost of your heat pump, there is no remaining expense to claim on your taxes. If HEAR covered only a portion, you may be able to claim 25C on the remaining out-of-pocket cost.</li>
        <li><strong>HEAR and state/utility rebates</strong>: Stacking rules vary by state. Some states allow HEAR rebates to be combined with state incentives and utility rebates, while others do not. Contact your state program administrator for specific guidance.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Who Should Prioritize HEAR</h2>
      <p>HEAR is particularly valuable for several groups of homeowners:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Low-income households</strong> who may not have sufficient tax liability to benefit from the 25C credit — HEAR's point-of-sale structure eliminates this barrier entirely.</li>
        <li><strong>Households replacing aging gas appliances</strong> — the combination of a heat pump ($8,000), heat pump water heater ($1,750), and induction stove ($840) can nearly eliminate a home's natural gas usage, reducing both energy costs and carbon emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Homes needing electrical upgrades</strong> — the $4,000 panel upgrade and $2,500 wiring rebates address one of the most common obstacles to electrification.</li>
        <li><strong>Renters</strong> — in states that extend HEAR eligibility to rental properties, landlords can access rebates for qualifying upgrades that benefit their tenants.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>The HEAR program represents a fundamental shift in how the federal government delivers energy incentives. By providing immediate, point-of-sale discounts targeted at the households that need them most, HEAR removes the financial barriers that have historically prevented low- and moderate-income Americans from accessing energy-efficient electric technologies. With up to $14,000 in per-household rebates and a streamlined application process, HEAR makes whole-home electrification a realistic possibility for millions of families across the country.</p>

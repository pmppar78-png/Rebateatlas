      <h1>2026 Energy Rebate Deadlines and Expiration Dates</h1>

      <p>Energy rebates and tax credits do not last forever. Some programs have firm expiration dates written into law, while others will simply run out of money on a first-come, first-served basis. Knowing the timeline for each program helps you prioritize which upgrades to make now and which can wait. This guide covers every major federal program's deadline, the step-down schedule for solar credits, and the urgency factors you need to understand for 2026.</p>

      <h2>Federal Program Timeline at a Glance</h2>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Program</th><th>Available Through</th><th>2026 Status</th><th>Urgency Level</th></tr>
        </thead>

          <tr><td>Section 25D (clean energy credit)</td><td>December 31, 2034</td><td>30% rate through 2032</td><td>Low - stable rate until 2033</td></tr>
          <tr><td>HOMES rebates</td><td>Until funds exhausted</td><td>Active in most states</td><td>Medium - limited funding pool</td></tr>
          <tr><td>HEAR rebates</td><td>Until funds exhausted</td><td>Active, funds depleting</td><td>High - first-come, first-served</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Section 30C (EV charger credit)</td><td>December 31, 2032</td><td>Full $1,000 available</td><td>Low - annual availability</td></tr>
          <tr><td>WAP (Weatherization Assistance)</td><td>Ongoing (IRA boost through funds)</td><td>Enhanced funding available</td><td>Medium - apply early</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>Section 25C: Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit</h2>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>The 25C credit is available for improvements placed in service from January 1, 2023 through December 31, 2032. The credit resets every tax year, meaning you can claim up to $3,200 in credits each year for qualifying improvements. This annual reset is a powerful planning tool.</p>

      <h3>What This Means for 2026</h3>
      <p>You have a fresh $3,200 cap available for the 2026 tax year (improvements made between January 1 and December 31, 2026). If you used part of your 2025 cap, your 2026 allowance is fully replenished. The $2,000 sub-cap for <a href="/categories/heat-pumps.html">heat pump equipment</a> also resets. If you have multiple projects planned, consider spreading them across calendar years to maximize the credit. For example, install a <a href="/categories/water-heaters.html">heat pump water heater</a> in 2026 (claiming $2,000) and <a href="/categories/windows-doors.html">new windows</a> plus <a href="/categories/insulation-weatherization.html">insulation</a> in 2027 (claiming up to $1,200).</p>

      <h2>Section 25D: Residential Clean Energy Credit</h2>

      <h3>Timeline and Step-Down Schedule</h3>
      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Installation Year</th><th>Credit Rate</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>2022 through 2032</td><td>30%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2033</td><td>26%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2034</td><td>22%</td></tr>
          <tr><td>2035 and beyond</td><td>0% (expires)</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h3>What This Means for 2026</h3>
      <p>For <a href="/categories/solar-panels.html">solar panel</a> and <a href="/categories/battery-storage.html">battery storage</a> installations, you have the full 30% credit rate through 2032. There is no urgency to rush from a credit-rate perspective. However, solar panel prices and installation costs may change over time, and some state incentives (like SRECs and utility rebates) have their own deadlines. See our <a href="/guides/solar-vs-battery.html">solar vs battery comparison</a> for current pricing.</p>

      <p>The 25D credit has no dollar cap and is not limited by a funding pool, so it will not "run out." As long as you install a qualifying system before the deadline, you get the credit. Unused credit can be carried forward to future tax years if your tax liability is insufficient in the installation year.</p>

      <h2>HOMES Rebates: The Funding Clock Is Ticking</h2>

      <h3>How Funding Works</h3>
      <p>Congress allocated approximately $4.3 billion for the HOMES program across all states. Each state received a formula-based allocation and is responsible for designing and administering its own program. Unlike tax credits, which are available to anyone who qualifies, HOMES rebates draw from a limited pool of money. Once a state's allocation is committed, the program closes in that state.</p>

      <h3>2026 Status</h3>
      <p>Most states launched their HOMES programs in 2024 or 2025. As of early 2026, many states still have available funds, but some are reporting significant uptake. States with smaller allocations or high demand (particularly those with aggressive marketing and simple application processes) may exhaust funds by late 2026 or 2027. There is no federal mechanism to replenish state allocations once they are spent.</p>

      <h3>Action Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Check your state's HOMES program status through your <a href="/states/">state rebate page</a></li>
        <li>If planning a whole-home efficiency project, apply for HOMES sooner rather than later</li>
        <li>Get an energy audit now, even if you are not ready to start construction immediately, as having an audit on file can speed the application process</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>HEAR Rebates: The Most Time-Sensitive Program</h2>

      <h3>Why HEAR Has the Highest Urgency</h3>
      <p>The HEAR program received approximately $4.5 billion in total federal funding. Like HOMES, this is distributed to states and operated on a first-come, first-served basis once each state's program launches. But HEAR's per-household rebate amounts are large ($7,000 to $14,000 depending on income), meaning the money can be committed quickly once programs are fully operational.</p>

      <h3>2026 Status</h3>
      <p>HEAR programs began rolling out in 2024 and 2025, with many states launching point-of-sale rebates at participating retailers and contractors. Demand has been strong, particularly for <a href="/categories/heat-pumps.html">heat pump HVAC systems</a> and electrical panel upgrades. States with smaller populations and proportionally smaller allocations are projected to exhaust HEAR funds first.</p>

      <h3>Action Items</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>If you are income-eligible (<a href="/guides/low-income-rebates.html">low-income</a> or <a href="/guides/moderate-income-eligibility.html">moderate-income</a>), prioritize HEAR applications now</li>
        <li>Do not wait for your existing equipment to fail before applying; proactive replacement while funds are available is the smart move</li>
        <li>Check if your state requires pre-approval before purchase, and start that process immediately</li>
        <li>Ask contractors if they are registered as HEAR participating providers in your state</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Section 30C: Alternative Fuel Vehicle Refueling Property Credit</h2>

      <h3>Timeline</h3>
      <p>The 30C credit for <a href="/categories/ev-chargers.html">EV charger installations</a> is available through December 31, 2032. Residential installations qualify for a credit of up to $1,000 (30% of costs). The property must be in an eligible census tract (low-income community or non-urban area). This geographic limitation was added by the IRA and narrows eligibility compared to the previous version of 30C.</p>

      <h3>What This Means for 2026</h3>
      <p>If your home is in an eligible census tract, you have until 2032 to claim this credit. Check eligibility by looking up your census tract on the Alternative Fuels Data Center website or <a href="/chat.html">ask our AI</a> with your address. The annual credit resets each year, but since most homeowners only install one charger, this reset is less relevant than for 25C.</p>

      <h2>State and Utility Program Deadlines</h2>

      <p>Beyond federal programs, state and utility incentives have their own timelines:</p>

      <h3>State-Level Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>State tax credits</strong>: These vary widely. Some states have permanent tax credits while others have sunset dates. New York's state solar credit, for example, has been extended multiple times but could expire</li>
        <li><strong>State rebate programs</strong>: Many states fund rebate programs through utility surcharges or dedicated funds that are replenished annually. These programs rarely "run out" but may adjust rebate amounts from year to year</li>
        <li><strong>SREC markets</strong>: Solar Renewable Energy Credit values fluctuate based on supply and demand within each state's market. Early solar adopters in SREC states benefit from higher initial credit values</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Utility-Level Considerations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Annual rebate budgets</strong>: Most utilities set annual rebate budgets. Programs that are popular may exhaust their budget mid-year and reopen the following January</li>
        <li><strong>Net metering changes</strong>: Several states are reviewing net metering policies. If your state is considering changes (as California did with NEM 3.0), installing solar before the policy change preserves your rate structure under grandfathering rules</li>
        <li><strong>EV charger utility rebates</strong>: Many utilities offer $200 to $500 for Level 2 charger installation, often with annual caps on the number of rebates issued</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>When to Act: Priority Matrix</h2>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr><th>Upgrade</th><th>Best Time to Act</th><th>Reason</th></tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          <tr><td>Heat pump (with HEAR)</td><td>Now - 2026</td><td>HEAR funds are limited and depleting</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Electrical panel (with HEAR)</td><td>Now - 2026</td><td>Same HEAR urgency; enables other electrification</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Heat pump water heater (with HEAR)</td><td>Now - 2026</td><td>HEAR funds; also strong 25C credit available</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Insulation and air sealing</td><td>2026 - 2027</td><td>HOMES funds available; 25C stable through 2032</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Solar panels</td><td>Anytime through 2032</td><td>30% credit stable; but state incentives may change</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Battery storage</td><td>Anytime through 2032</td><td>30% credit stable; prices trending down</td></tr>
          <tr><td>Windows and doors</td><td>2026 - 2032</td><td>25C resets annually; spread across years if needed</td></tr>
          <tr><td>EV charger</td><td>When you need it, through 2032</td><td>30C credit stable; check census tract eligibility</td></tr>
        </tbody>
      </table>

      <h2>The Bottom Line for 2026</h2>

      <p>The most urgent action items for 2026 center on the HEAR rebate program. If you are income-eligible and considering a heat pump, heat pump water heater, or electrical panel upgrade, apply now before state funding is exhausted. These are the largest point-of-sale rebates available and they will not be replenished once gone.</p>

      <p>For tax credits (25C, 25D, 30C), you have more breathing room through 2032, but there is still value in acting sooner: energy prices continue to rise, making the savings from efficient equipment more valuable each year. And spreading projects across tax years lets you maximize the annual 25C cap.</p>

      <p>For HOMES rebates, the urgency is moderate. Funds are still available in most states, but they are finite. If you are planning a whole-home efficiency project, get your energy audit done in 2026 even if construction will not begin until later.</p>

      <h1>Manufactured Home &amp; Mobile Home Energy Rebates</h1>

      <p>Manufactured homes and mobile homes represent approximately 6% of the U.S. housing stock, roughly 22 million residents. These homes face unique energy challenges: thinner walls, less insulation, single-pane windows, and ductwork running through unconditioned spaces beneath the floor. The result is energy bills that are often 50% to 70% higher per square foot than comparable site-built homes. The good news is that all major federal rebate programs explicitly include manufactured housing, and the potential savings from upgrades are especially dramatic.</p>

      <h2>Unique Energy Challenges</h2>

      <p>Understanding what makes manufactured homes different helps you prioritize the most impactful upgrades:</p>

      <h3>Construction and Insulation Standards</h3>
      <p>Manufactured homes built before 1976 predate the HUD Code (the federal building standard for manufactured housing) and often have minimal insulation. Even homes built to the HUD Code through the 1990s typically have significantly less insulation than site-built homes of the same era. Wall cavities may contain only R-7 to R-11 insulation compared to R-13 to R-21 in site-built homes. Ceiling insulation is often R-14 to R-22 compared to R-38 to R-60 in modern site-built construction.</p>

      <h3>Belly and Floor Issues</h3>
      <p>The underside of a manufactured home, called the belly or belly board, is a common source of energy loss. The belly wrap (a thin barrier beneath the floor) can sag, tear, or deteriorate over time, exposing ductwork and insulation to outdoor air. Duct leakage in the belly cavity is one of the single largest energy waste problems in manufactured housing, with studies showing 20% to 40% of heated and cooled air escaping before it reaches living spaces.</p>

      <h3>Skirting</h3>
      <p>The skirting around the base of a manufactured home creates a semi-conditioned crawlspace that protects plumbing from freezing and reduces wind exposure on the belly. Missing, damaged, or poorly sealed skirting significantly increases energy loss and can lead to frozen pipes in winter.</p>

      <h2>Which Federal Programs Apply to Manufactured Homes</h2>

      <p>All IRA rebate programs explicitly include manufactured housing. Here is a complete overview:</p>

      <h3>Section 25C: Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit</h3>
      <p>Manufactured homeowners can claim the full 25C tax credit on qualifying improvements including <a href="/categories/heat-pumps.html">heat pumps</a> (up to $2,000), <a href="/categories/water-heaters.html">heat pump water heaters</a> (up to $2,000), <a href="/categories/insulation-weatherization.html">insulation and air sealing</a> (up to $1,200), <a href="/categories/windows-doors.html">windows and doors</a> (up to $600 each), and electrical panel upgrades (up to $600). The manufactured home must be your primary residence.</p>

      <h3>HOMES Rebates</h3>
      <p>The Home Efficiency Rebates program is particularly valuable for manufactured homes because these homes often achieve large percentage energy reductions from relatively affordable improvements. A $5,000 combination of belly insulation, duct sealing, and air sealing can easily achieve a 35% or greater energy reduction, qualifying for the maximum rebate of $4,000 (standard income) or $8,000 (<a href="/guides/low-income-rebates.html">low-income households</a>).</p>

      <h3>HEAR Rebates</h3>
      <p>Income-qualifying manufactured homeowners can access the full HEAR rebate amounts: up to $8,000 for a heat pump HVAC system, $1,750 for a heat pump water heater, $1,600 for insulation and air sealing, and more. The $14,000 lifetime cap ($7,000 for <a href="/guides/moderate-income-eligibility.html">moderate-income</a>) applies. These point-of-sale rebates are especially impactful for manufactured home residents, who are disproportionately lower-income.</p>

      <h3>Section 25D: Residential Clean Energy Credit</h3>
      <p>Manufactured homeowners can install <a href="/categories/solar-panels.html">solar panels</a> and <a href="/categories/battery-storage.html">battery storage</a> and claim the 30% tax credit, just like site-built homeowners. Ground-mounted solar systems are often preferred for manufactured homes because roof structures may not support the additional weight. Ground-mount systems qualify for the same 25D credit.</p>

      <h2>WAP Priority for Manufactured Homes</h2>

      <p>The Weatherization Assistance Program gives priority to manufactured homes in many states because the energy savings potential is so high relative to cost. WAP providers have specialized training for manufactured housing and perform upgrades that are specific to these structures:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Belly insulation repair and addition</strong>: Repairing the belly wrap and adding blown insulation beneath the floor</li>
        <li><strong>Duct sealing and repair</strong>: Sealing the extensive ductwork that runs through the belly cavity</li>
        <li><strong>Roof and ceiling insulation</strong>: Adding blown cellulose or fiberglass to the attic or roof cavity</li>
        <li><strong>Wall insulation</strong>: Where accessible, adding insulation to exterior wall cavities</li>
        <li><strong>Window and door replacement or repair</strong>: Replacing single-pane windows and sealing door frames</li>
        <li><strong>Skirting repair</strong>: Repairing or replacing damaged skirting to protect the belly cavity</li>
        <li><strong>HVAC replacement</strong>: Replacing old, inefficient furnaces or heat pumps</li>
        <li><strong>Water heater replacement or wrapping</strong>: Insulating or replacing inefficient water heaters</li>
      </ul>

      <p>WAP services are provided at no cost to qualifying households. Eligibility is generally at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Contact your local Community Action Agency or call 211 to apply.</p>

      <h2>Common High-Impact Upgrades</h2>

      <p>Based on energy audits of thousands of manufactured homes, these are the upgrades that typically provide the greatest energy savings per dollar spent:</p>

      <h3>1. Duct Sealing (ROI: Excellent)</h3>
      <p>Sealing duct connections and repairing belly wrap can reduce heating and cooling energy use by 15% to 25%. This is often the single most cost-effective improvement, costing $500 to $2,000 and potentially saving $200 to $500 per year.</p>

      <h3>2. Belly Insulation (ROI: Very Good)</h3>
      <p>Adding or repairing belly insulation reduces floor heat loss significantly. Combined with duct sealing, this addresses the largest energy loss pathway in most manufactured homes. Cost: $1,500 to $4,000. Annual savings: $150 to $400.</p>

      <h3>3. Air Sealing (ROI: Very Good)</h3>
      <p>Manufactured homes often have significant air leakage around plumbing penetrations, electrical outlets, window frames, and the marriage line (where double-wide sections join). Professional air sealing costs $500 to $2,000 and can reduce energy use by 10% to 20%.</p>

      <h3>4. Heat Pump Installation (ROI: Good with Rebates)</h3>
      <p>Replacing an old electric furnace or propane furnace with an <a href="/categories/heat-pumps.html">air-source heat pump</a> dramatically reduces heating costs. Mini-split heat pumps are especially well-suited to manufactured homes because they do not require ductwork. With HEAR rebates covering up to $8,000, the net cost can be minimal. See our <a href="/guides/heat-pump-vs-furnace.html">heat pump vs furnace comparison</a> for full details.</p>

      <h3>5. Window Replacement (ROI: Moderate)</h3>
      <p>Many manufactured homes still have single-pane aluminum-frame windows. Replacing them with double-pane vinyl windows reduces heat loss and improves comfort. Manufactured home windows are typically non-standard sizes, so ensure you order windows specifically designed for manufactured housing. The 25C credit covers up to $600 for <a href="/categories/windows-doors.html">qualifying windows</a>.</p>

      <h2>ENERGY STAR Manufactured Home Program</h2>

      <p>If you are purchasing a new manufactured home, look for the ENERGY STAR certification. ENERGY STAR certified manufactured homes are built to significantly higher efficiency standards than the base HUD Code requires. They feature enhanced insulation, high-performance windows, tight duct systems, and efficient HVAC equipment. An ENERGY STAR manufactured home uses 30% to 40% less energy than a standard new manufactured home, saving $400 to $800 per year in energy costs from day one.</p>

      <p>New ENERGY STAR manufactured homes may also qualify for the Section 45L New Energy Efficient Home Credit, which provides the manufacturer or retailer with a tax credit that may be passed on to the buyer as a price reduction.</p>

      <h2>State-Specific Programs</h2>

      <p>Several states have programs specifically targeting manufactured housing energy efficiency:</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Oregon</strong>: Manufactured home replacement program for very old, inefficient homes</li>
        <li><strong>Washington</strong>: Enhanced WAP funding for manufactured homes in rural areas</li>
        <li><strong>North Carolina</strong>: Manufactured home weatherization through the NC Department of Environmental Quality</li>
        <li><strong>Texas</strong>: Utility programs with specific manufactured home insulation and HVAC rebates</li>
        <li><strong>Montana</strong>: Manufactured home energy upgrade grants through the Montana Department of Environmental Quality</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Check your <a href="/states/">state rebate page</a> for the complete list of programs in your area.</p>

      <h2>Getting Started</h2>

      <p>If you live in a manufactured or mobile home, the potential energy savings from rebate-supported upgrades are among the highest of any housing type. Start by determining your income eligibility for HEAR and HOMES programs, and apply for WAP if your income qualifies. Even if your income is above the low-income threshold, the 25C tax credit alone can make major improvements affordable.</p>

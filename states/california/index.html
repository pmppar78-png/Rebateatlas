        the key programs available in California, including heat pump rebates, solar incentives, EV charger credits,
        weatherization assistance, and more. Each program listed below includes eligibility details and links to
        official sources.

California has launched both the HOMES (Home Owner Managing Energy Savings) and HEAR (High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate) programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, making additional point-of-sale rebates available to qualifying residents. The California Energy Commission (CEC) coordinates state-level energy programs and can provide the latest information on available incentives.
      </p>

      <h2>HOMES &amp; HEAR Program Status in California</h2>
      <p>California has launched its HOMES and HEAR rebate programs. The California Energy Commission (CEC) administers the programs, branded in part through existing infrastructure. California was among the first states to begin accepting applications, leveraging its existing energy efficiency program ecosystem.</p>

      <h2>Income Eligibility for California Rebates</h2>
      <p>For California, 80% of Area Median Income varies significantly by county due to high cost of living. In Los Angeles County, 80% AMI for a family of four is approximately $76,100. In the San Francisco Bay Area, it can exceed $100,000.</p>

      <h3>Does California have net metering for solar panels?</h3>
      <p>California transitioned from NEM 2.0 to Net Billing (NEM 3.0) in April 2023. Under NEM 3.0, export compensation rates are based on the avoided cost calculator and vary by time of day, significantly reducing the value of exported solar energy compared to NEM 2.0. This change strongly incentivizes battery storage paired with solar. Existing NEM 1.0 and 2.0 customers are grandfathered for 20 years from their interconnection date.</p>
      <h3>How do I apply for energy rebates in California?</h3>
      <p>Start by entering your ZIP code on Rebate Atlas to get personalized guidance. For federal tax credits (25C and 25D), you claim them when you file your federal income tax return using IRS Form 5695. For state programs, contact the California Energy Commission (CEC). For utility rebates, check with your local utility provider directly.</p>

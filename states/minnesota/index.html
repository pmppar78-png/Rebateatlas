Minnesota has launched both the HOMES (Home Owner Managing Energy Savings) and HEAR (High-Efficiency Electric Home Rebate) programs under the Inflation Reduction Act, making additional point-of-sale rebates available to qualifying residents. The Minnesota Department of Commerce - Division of Energy Resources coordinates state-level energy programs and can provide the latest information on available incentives.
      </p>

      <h2>HOMES &amp; HEAR Program Status in Minnesota</h2>
      <p>Minnesota has launched HOMES and HEAR programs through the Minnesota Department of Commerce. The state received approximately $80 million in IRA funding for energy efficiency and electrification rebates, complementing existing Conservation Improvement Programs (CIP) run by utilities.</p>

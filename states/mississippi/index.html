      <h1>Energy Rebates &amp; Incentives in Mississippi</h1>

      <p>Mississippi faces some of the highest residential energy burdens in the nation, with hot, humid summers driving substantial cooling costs for homeowners across the state. The combination of an aging housing stock and limited state-level incentives makes federal programs and utility rebates especially important for Magnolia State residents looking to cut their energy bills. Whether you live in the Jackson metro, along the Gulf Coast, or in the rural Delta region, there are meaningful opportunities to save on energy-efficient upgrades.</p>

      <h2>HOMES &amp; HEAR Rebates in Mississippi</h2>
      <p>Mississippi's <a href="/guides/homes-rebate-program.html" class="inline-link">HOMES rebate program</a> and <a href="/guides/hear-rebate-program.html" class="inline-link">HEAR rebate program</a> are currently pending launch. The Mississippi Development Authority - Energy Division is working on program design and implementation using approximately $50 million in IRA funding allocated to the state. Once launched, the HOMES program will provide rebates for whole-home energy efficiency retrofits that demonstrate measurable energy savings, while the HEAR program will offer point-of-sale discounts on high-efficiency electric appliances such as heat pumps, heat pump water heaters, electric stoves, and heat pump dryers. Low-income households earning below 80% of area median income will qualify for the largest rebates, potentially up to $8,000 for a heat pump installation. Moderate-income households will also be eligible for partial rebates. Mississippi residents should monitor the Mississippi Development Authority website for announcements on program availability and enrollment timelines.</p>

      <h2>Federal Tax Credits for Mississippi Homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/25c-tax-credit.html" class="inline-link">25C Home Improvement Credit</a>:</strong> Mississippi homeowners can claim up to $3,200 per year for qualifying energy-efficient improvements. This includes up to $2,000 for heat pumps and heat pump water heaters, plus up to $1,200 for insulation, windows, doors, and electrical panel upgrades. Given Mississippi's heavy reliance on air conditioning, upgrading to a high-efficiency heat pump through a qualified installer like <a href="https://www.angi.com/?ref=rebateatlas" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Angi</a> can yield significant year-round savings on both heating and cooling.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/25d-clean-energy-credit.html" class="inline-link">25D Clean Energy Credit</a>:</strong> A 30% federal tax credit with no cap applies to solar photovoltaic systems, battery storage, and geothermal heat pumps. Mississippi receives abundant sunshine, making solar an attractive option. Compare quotes from installers through <a href="https://www.energysage.com/?rc=rebateatlas" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">EnergySage</a> to find the best deal in your area.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/30c-ev-charger-credit.html" class="inline-link">30C EV Charger Credit</a>:</strong> Homeowners in eligible census tracts can receive up to $1,000 (30% of cost) for installing a home EV charging station. Many rural and low-income areas in Mississippi qualify, making this credit accessible to a broad range of residents.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Mississippi State Rebate Programs</h2>
      <p>Mississippi's primary state-administered program is the <strong>Mississippi Weatherization Assistance Program</strong>, managed by the Mississippi Department of Human Services through local Community Action Agencies. This program provides an average of $7,000 or more per home in energy efficiency improvements, including insulation, air sealing, HVAC repair and replacement, duct sealing, and window and door repairs. The program is available to households at or below 200% of the federal poverty level. Given the prevalence of older, poorly insulated homes throughout Mississippi, this program can make a dramatic difference in both comfort and monthly energy costs. Contact your local Community Action Agency to apply and schedule an energy assessment.</p>

      <h2>State Tax Credits &amp; Incentives</h2>
      <p>Mississippi does not currently offer state-level tax credits for residential renewable energy or energy efficiency improvements. Unlike some neighboring states, there are no state solar tax credits, energy efficiency credits, or renewable energy purchase incentives for residential customers. However, Mississippi homeowners can still take full advantage of the federal 30% Investment Tax Credit for solar PV and battery storage systems, which provides substantial savings on installation costs. The absence of state credits makes it especially important for Mississippi residents to maximize every available federal incentive and utility rebate.</p>

      <h2>Net Metering &amp; Solar Policy in Mississippi</h2>
      <p>Mississippi established net metering rules in 2015 through the Mississippi Public Service Commission. Solar and other renewable energy systems up to 2 MW qualify for net metering with investor-owned utilities, including Entergy Mississippi and Mississippi Power. Excess generation is credited at the avoided cost rate, which is typically lower than the retail electricity rate. Rural electric cooperatives and municipal utilities may have separate policies and may or may not offer net metering. Before investing in a solar system, Mississippi homeowners should confirm their utility's specific net metering terms and understand how excess generation credits will be calculated over the course of a year.</p>

      <h2>Utility Rebate Programs</h2>
      <h3>Entergy Mississippi</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Entergy Solutions Residential Program:</strong> Offers $25 to $500 depending on the measure, covering smart thermostats, HVAC tune-ups, duct sealing, insulation, and LED lighting. A <a href="https://www.ecobee.com/?ref=rebateatlas" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">smart thermostat from Ecobee</a> paired with this rebate is a cost-effective first step toward lower energy bills.</li>
        <li><strong>Entergy Mississippi Income-Qualified Weatherization:</strong> Provides free weatherization improvements for qualifying low-income customers, including air sealing, insulation, HVAC repair, and LED lighting.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Mississippi Power (Southern Company)</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Residential Energy Efficiency Programs:</strong> Rebates of $25 to $400 depending on the measure for HVAC tune-ups, duct sealing, insulation, LED lighting, and smart thermostats.</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>TVA-served Cooperatives and Municipalities</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>TVA EnergyRight Residential Solutions:</strong> Rebates up to $2,000 for heat pumps, insulation, duct sealing, ENERGY STAR windows, smart thermostats, and whole-home energy assessments. The TVA EnergyRight program is one of the most generous utility rebate programs available to Mississippi residents and covers a wide range of improvements.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Income Eligibility in Mississippi</h2>
      <p>Understanding income eligibility is critical for Mississippi households seeking the largest possible rebates. For <a href="/guides/low-income-rebates.html" class="inline-link">low-income households</a>, the threshold is 80% of area median income, which in Jackson is approximately $49,900 for a family of four. Households below this level will qualify for the highest rebate tiers under the HOMES program when it launches, as well as programs like the Weatherization Assistance Program and Entergy's income-qualified weatherization. For <a href="/guides/moderate-income-eligibility.html" class="inline-link">moderate-income households</a>, the threshold is 150% of AMI, approximately $93,600 for a family of four in Jackson. These households will qualify for partial HOMES rebates. Even households above these thresholds benefit from federal tax credits, utility rebates, and the performance-based HOMES pathway that rewards demonstrated energy savings regardless of income.</p>

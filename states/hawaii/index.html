      <h1>Energy Rebates &amp; Incentives in Hawaii</h1>

      <p>Hawaii holds the distinction of having the highest electricity rates in the nation, with residential customers often paying three to four times the national average. The state's isolated island grid, historically dependent on imported petroleum, makes energy efficiency and renewable energy adoption especially impactful for local households. Fortunately, Hawaii has committed to a 100% renewable energy goal by 2045, and a rich ecosystem of federal, state, and utility incentives exists to help residents cut costs while contributing to that clean energy future.</p>

      <h2>HOMES &amp; HEAR Rebates in Hawaii</h2>
      <p>Hawaii has launched both the <a href="/guides/homes-rebate-program.html" class="inline-link">HOMES rebate program</a> and the <a href="/guides/hear-rebate-program.html" class="inline-link">HEAR rebate program</a> through the Hawaii State Energy Office. Backed by over $48 million in Inflation Reduction Act funding, these programs provide substantial point-of-sale rebates for whole-home energy efficiency retrofits and high-efficiency electric appliances. The HOMES program rewards measured energy savings achieved through comprehensive home upgrades, while the HEAR program targets individual appliance replacements such as heat pump HVAC systems, heat pump water heaters, electric stoves, and heat pump clothes dryers. For island households already struggling with elevated utility bills, these rebates can make electrification projects dramatically more affordable.</p>

      <h2>Federal Tax Credits for Hawaii Homeowners</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/25c-tax-credit.html" class="inline-link">25C Home Improvement Credit</a>:</strong> Hawaii homeowners can claim up to $3,200 per year for qualifying energy efficiency improvements, including up to $2,000 for heat pumps and heat pump water heaters, plus up to $1,200 for insulation, windows, doors, and electrical panel upgrades. Given Hawaii's warm climate, efficient cooling and water heating upgrades deliver especially strong returns.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/25d-clean-energy-credit.html" class="inline-link">25D Clean Energy Credit</a>:</strong> This uncapped 30% federal tax credit covers the full installed cost of solar panels, battery storage systems, and geothermal heat pumps. With Hawaii's exceptional solar irradiance, a rooftop solar system paired with battery storage is one of the smartest investments a homeowner can make. Consider getting quotes through <a href="https://www.energysage.com/?rc=rebateatlas" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">EnergySage</a> to compare local installer pricing.</li>
        <li><strong><a href="/guides/30c-ev-charger-credit.html" class="inline-link">30C EV Charger Credit</a>:</strong> Homeowners in eligible census tracts can receive up to $1,000 (30% of cost) for installing a home EV charging station. With gasoline prices in Hawaii consistently among the highest in the country, pairing a home charger with an electric vehicle delivers significant long-term savings.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Hawaii State Rebate Programs</h2>
      <p>The Hawaii Energy Efficiency Rebate Program, administered by Hawaii Energy (a Leidos-managed ratepayer-funded initiative), offers $200 to $1,500 in rebates depending on the upgrade. Eligible measures include energy-efficient appliances, LED lighting, HVAC systems, heat pump water heaters, and building envelope improvements. These rebates are available to residential and commercial customers of HECO, MECO, and HELCO across the islands.</p>
      <p>Hawaii Energy also runs a dedicated Heat Pump Water Heater Rebate offering up to $1,000 for qualifying ENERGY STAR certified heat pump water heaters that replace electric resistance or propane units. Additional bonuses may be available for income-qualified households. A licensed contractor must handle the installation. Because water heating accounts for a large share of residential energy use in Hawaii, this upgrade alone can noticeably reduce monthly bills. If you need help finding a qualified installer, platforms like <a href="https://www.thumbtack.com/?utm_source=rebateatlas&amp;utm_medium=affiliate" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">Thumbtack</a> can connect you with licensed professionals in your area.</p>

      <h2>State Tax Credits &amp; Incentives</h2>
      <p>Hawaii offers the Renewable Energy Technologies Income Tax Credit, one of the most valuable state-level solar incentives in the country. Homeowners can claim 35% of the installed cost for solar PV systems (capped at $5,000), 35% for solar thermal systems (capped at $2,250), and 20% for wind systems (capped at $1,500). This non-refundable state credit stacks directly with the federal 30% Investment Tax Credit, meaning a Hawaii homeowner installing solar panels can potentially offset 65% of the system cost through combined credits. Battery storage systems paired with renewable energy also qualify. The credit can be carried forward to future tax years if not fully used.</p>

      <h2>Net Metering &amp; Solar Policy in Hawaii</h2>
      <p>Hawaii transitioned from traditional net metering to the Customer Grid-Supply (CGS) and Customer Self-Supply (CSS) programs. Under CGS, homeowners with grid-connected solar receive export credits at a rate lower than the retail electricity price, typically between $0.10 and $0.15 per kWh depending on the island. The CSS option requires all solar generation to be consumed on-site, which works well for homes with battery storage. Hawaii also offers Smart Export programs with time-of-use export credits that reward homeowners for sending power to the grid during peak demand periods. Given these structures, pairing solar with a <a href="https://www.ecoflow.com/?ref=rebateatlas" class="affiliate-link" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer">home battery system</a> is particularly advantageous in Hawaii to maximize self-consumption and minimize reliance on grid power.</p>

      <h2>Utility Rebate Programs</h2>
      <p>Hawaiian Electric (HECO), the primary utility serving Oahu, offers several programs for residential customers. The Customer Grid-Supply Program provides export credit rates that vary by island (approximately $0.10 to $0.15 per kWh) for grid-connected solar PV and battery systems. HECO's Battery Bonus Program offers up to $850 per kW for residential battery storage paired with solar PV, representing a significant incentive for homeowners looking to add energy resilience. A Time-of-Use Rate Program is also available for customers with smart meters, offering lower rates during off-peak hours and higher rates during the 5 to 9 PM peak window.</p>
      <p>Maui Electric (MECO) and Hawaii Electric Light (HELCO), serving the outer islands, offer their own Customer Renewable Programs with solar PV and battery storage export credits that vary by program tier. Across all the islands, the combination of utility programs, state credits, and federal incentives makes going solar in Hawaii one of the strongest financial propositions in the entire United States.</p>

      <h2>Income Eligibility in Hawaii</h2>
      <p>Income thresholds for the enhanced HOMES and HEAR rebates are based on Area Median Income. In Honolulu County, 80% AMI for a family of four is approximately $86,400, while outer islands have lower thresholds. Households at or below this level qualify as <a href="/guides/low-income-rebates.html" class="inline-link">low-income</a> and can receive up to 100% of project costs covered under HOMES. <a href="/guides/moderate-income-eligibility.html" class="inline-link">Moderate-income</a> households (up to 150% AMI, approximately $162,000 for a family of four in Honolulu) qualify for rebates covering up to 50% of project costs. These income-based enhancements ensure that the benefits of energy efficiency reach the families who need them most.</p>

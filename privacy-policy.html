      <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
      <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 24, 2025</p>

      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Rebate Atlas ("we," "our," or "us") operates a free educational website that helps US households
        understand energy-efficiency rebates, tax credits, and incentives. This Privacy Policy explains
        how we collect, use, and protect information when you use our website.
      </p>

      <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
      <p>
        <strong>Information You Provide:</strong> When you use our AI chat assistant, you may voluntarily
        provide information such as your ZIP code, home type, and details about planned home improvements.
        This information is used solely to provide you with relevant rebate guidance during your session.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Automatically Collected Information:</strong> Like most websites, we may automatically
        collect certain technical information through standard web technologies, including IP addresses,
        browser types, referring pages, pages visited, and timestamps. This helps us understand how visitors
        use our site and improve our service.
      </p>

      <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <p>We use the information we collect to:</p>
      <ul>

        <li>Improve and optimize our website and services</li>
        <li>Analyze site usage and performance</li>
        <li>Comply with legal obligations</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Information Sharing</h2>
      <p>

        following limited circumstances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Service Providers:</strong> We may share information with trusted third-party service
        providers who help us operate our website (such as hosting providers and AI service providers).
        These providers are contractually obligated to protect your information.</li>
        <li><strong>Legal Requirements:</strong> We may disclose information if required by law or in
        response to valid legal requests.</li>

      </ul>

      <h2>Affiliate Relationships</h2>

        Our website includes affiliate links to trusted partner services. When you click these links and
        use a partner's service, we may earn a referral commission at no additional cost to you. These
        affiliate relationships help us provide free educational resources. All affiliate links are clearly
        marked with appropriate disclosures.
      </p>

      <h2>Data Security</h2>
      <p>
        We implement reasonable security measures to protect your information from unauthorized access,
        alteration, disclosure, or destruction. However, no internet transmission is completely secure,
        and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
